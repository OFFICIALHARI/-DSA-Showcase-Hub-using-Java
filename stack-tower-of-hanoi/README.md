# 🗼 Stack – Tower of Hanoi Solver

## 💡 What is a Stack?
A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

## 🧩 Use Case
This project uses stacks to simulate the **Tower of Hanoi** problem—a classic recursive problem that demonstrates how stacks can manage state and recursion-like behavior.

## ✅ Why Stack is the Perfect Choice?
- Simulates recursive steps using LIFO.
- Helps track disk movement history.
- Ideal for backtracking, undo operations, and step-wise simulations.

## 🧪 Inputs and Outputs
| Action      | Input (e.g., 3) | Output                                    |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Start Game  | Number of disks  | Shows tower states and all move steps     |
| Auto Solve  | Built-in logic   | Recursively solves and prints every move  |

## 🔁 Towers
- `Tower A` = Source Stack
- `Tower B` = Auxiliary Stack
- `Tower C` = Destination Stack

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Save the code as `StackTowerOfHanoi.java`
2. Compile and run using:
```bash
javac StackTowerOfHanoi.java
java StackTowerOfHanoi
