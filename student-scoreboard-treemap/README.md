# 🧠 Student Scoreboard using TreeMap

### ✅ Problem
Manage student marks where:
- Students are identified by roll number.
- Data should be stored and displayed in sorted order.
- Marks should be updatable.
- Quickly find the student with the smallest and largest roll number.

### 💡 Why TreeMap?

- Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion in O(log n) time.
- Built-in `firstKey()` and `lastKey()` helps find extremes easily.
