# 📇 Contact Management using Binary Search Tree (BST)

### ✅ Problem
Create a system to:
- Add new contact names.
- Show contacts in alphabetical order.
- Search for a contact quickly.

### 💡 Why BST?
- Maintains sorted order automatically.
- Efficient O(log n) insert and search (average case).
- Clean alphabetical display via in-order traversal.

### 👨‍💻 Features
- `insert(name)`: Adds contact.
- `search(name)`: Checks if contact exists.
- `inorder()`: Lists all contacts alphabetically.
