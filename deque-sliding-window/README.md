This Java mini project finds the **maximum in every sliding window** of size `k` in a given array using `Deque`.

## ðŸ’¡ Data Structure Used
**Deque (Double-ended queue)**

## âœ… Why Deque?
- Maintains a list of indices in decreasing order of values.
- Allows fast removal from both ends.
- Efficient O(n) solution for sliding window maximum.

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case
- Real-time stock price monitoring (max in last 3 mins).
- Sensor data stream (max temperature/humidity every few seconds).

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac SlidingWindowMaximum.java
